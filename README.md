# Module 2 - VBA Challenge
This repository will be used for the Module 2 VBA challenge.

## Description

I completed this project to test my VBA skills and analyze generated stock market data from my boot camp. I organized my discoveries in a summary table that includes the ticker symbol, the yearly stock price change, the percent change by year, and the total stock volume. I then took it a step further to find the ticker symbol with the greatest percent increase by year and on the other hand I found the greatest percent decrease over the year. Then I found the stock with the greatest total volume.

## Visuals
The attached screenshots are of the results of the project. They display a shortened list of the stock summary table with the stocks with the greatest percent increase/decrease and total volume from 2020 to 2018, respectively.

## Authors and Acknowledgement

I solely worked on this project, however, I did utilize websites like Stack Overflow, Automate Excel, and Excel Champs to complete some tasks that we did not learn in our prior boot camp classes. 

For some of these examples, I utilized the below link to find the last row in a column, for example, last_row = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row

I also used the below link to show me how to add conditional formatting through VBA.

I used this last link below to help me loop through the multiple worksheets in my Excel workbook.
